They protect shorelines from erosion, buffer communities against storms and serve as nurseries for countless marine animals.

The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking colour to neighbourhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonisation, maritime trade and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from approximately 16°C in winter to 27°C in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe.",

Though absent from the driest regions of western India, it thrives in diverse habitats—from lowland plains to elevations of about 2,000 metres—often favouring areas with tall palm trees, forest clearings, and cultivated landscapes. These compact birds are easily recognised by their short, curved bills, square tails and long wings. They are usually seen in small groups, huddled closely together on bare branches, power lines or pylons, occasionally preening one another. Agile in flight, they make aerial sallies to catch insects mid-air—sometimes holding the prey in their feet, tearing it apart with their beaks. While they typically feed on the wing, they may also return to a perch—or even land on the ground—to consume their catch or visit birdbaths.",

      "description": "As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of colour. The national park, located in southwestern South Dakota, United States, features a dramatic terrain of eroded buttes, pinnacles and spires carved by millennia of wind and water. Spanning over 98,160 hectares, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor centre and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about two centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats.",

With a diameter of about 3,474 kilometres—roughly one-quarter that of Earth—it exerts only one-sixth of our planet's gravity. This is why astronauts famously bounce when they walk on its surface. The moon's surface is mostly covered with rock and fine lunar dust, created by billions of years of impacts from meteoroids and micrometeorites.

Eucalyptus is now one of the most planted species in the country, the basis for the production of paper, cellulose and charcoal. When well-managed, especially in already degraded areas, it can relieve pressure on native forests and favour soil recovery. However, in large areas, the continuous cultivation of eucalyptus can alter the local environment, affecting biodiversity and water dynamics.",

These remarkable trees are the oldest non-clonal species on Earth. Shaped by relentless wind, snow and rain, they've endured for millennia—witnessing ice ages, volcanic eruptions and the rise and fall of civilisations. Their incredibly slow growth results in wood that's dense and highly resistant to insects, fungi, decay and erosion. Against all odds, the Great Basin bristlecones cling to life on barren limestone ridges, twisting into forms that appear almost sculpted by time. Their scattered presence across isolated mountain ranges may be due to wind dispersal, the help of birds like the Clark's nutcracker, or even now-extinct species that once carried their seeds across the highlands.",

      "description": "The blue shark, featured here, is sleek, wide-ranging and undeniably captivating. It's the only member of its genus that prefers the deep waters of temperate and tropical oceans. While typically a laid-back swimmer, it's capable of sudden bursts of speed when needed. Blue sharks are famous for their epic migrations—some travel from New England to South America, guided by seasonal changes, food availability and favourable environmental conditions. They give birth to live young and are known for their large litters—ranging from 25 to over 100 pups. After birth, the young head to special nursery zones, far from adult habitats, where they can grow and learn the ways of the sea.",

Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs. Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns. These sea cliffs are shaped into natural sculptures so symmetrical that they look almost man-made. These striking formations were created around 2 million years ago, when thick basalt lava cooled slowly, contracting and cracking into geometric shapes that formed near-perfect hexagons. Though Iceland is full of volcanic marvels, formations like these are rare, making this quiet cove truly remarkable.",

Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities.",

One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators.

This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide.",

The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore. Sometimes, when the air and ground temperatures are just right, the Tor looks like it's floating above the mist—a trick of the light called a Fata Morgana. The name comes from Morgan le Fay, a sorceress in Arthurian legends. The Tor stands in the heart of the Summerland Meadows, which are part of the Somerset Levels. It rises to an elevation of 158 metres and is clearly visible from far away, making it a striking landmark. Although often described as an island, the Tor actually sits at the western tip of a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the River Brue.",

What you see at Arches National Park in Utah, United States, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.",

      "description": "Stretching over 560 kilometres along Brazil's southern Atlantic, Santa Catarina's coast is a place shaped by history and change. Long before European ships appeared on the horizon, the Carijós—skilled fishermen and farmers of the Tupi-Guarani group—lived here. By 1529, explorers had charted these waters and the name 'Santa Catarina' appeared on world maps. In the 18th century, waves of Azorean settlers arrived. The coast became a stage for disputes between Portugal and Spain, and in the centuries that followed, German and Italian immigrants added new colours to the region's tapestry. Fishing communities and ports flourished throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.",

Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly is known for its vivid colouration and powerful flight, making it a frequent visitor to both urban gardens and wild habitats. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important. The Asian swallowtail uses sophisticated colour vision and colour constancy to identify flowers, especially those in the citrus family, even under changing light conditions. This remarkable ability allows it to remain an effective pollinator across a wide range of environments. Delicate yet determined, the Asian swallowtail reminds us that even the smallest pollinators play a big role in keeping nature balanced and beautiful.",

Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines.",

Among them, the leatherback sea turtle is the largest, sometimes reaching almost 2 metres in length and weighing between 300 to 640 kilograms. Each species has unique behaviours, diets and nesting patterns—yet all share a deep connection to coastal and marine environments.

Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a national park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.",

It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds.

Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for almost 2 kilometres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.",

Today's image features Steller sea lions gliding through the chilly waters off the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada. These marine mammals are heavy—females average more than 260 kilograms, while males are around 540 kilograms. Males are noticeably larger than females and are known for their loud roars and flatter snouts. Their deep vocalisations include belching, growling and snorting to warn others and communicate underwater. Males get loud to defend turf, while moms and pups use unique calls to find each other in a crowded rookery. Despite their size, they're preyed on by orcas and large sharks. These sea lions are considered near-threatened. Ocean conservation keeps them—and countless other mammals—afloat.",

Today, it is a common sight in rural landscapes, particularly in Normandy, where it finds refuge in hedgerows, field edges and flowering meadows. Although it is not a threatened species, its survival depends on the quality of agricultural areas. The loss of hedges, wasteland and fallow fields reduces areas where it can nest and seek shelter.",
