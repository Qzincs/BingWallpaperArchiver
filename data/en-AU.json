This uninhabited green islet sits quietly just south of the town of Vila Franca do Campo. Beneath its serene surface, this gem holds a lively past. First documented in 1537, around the time when settlers from São Miguel began expanding westward, Vila Franca Islet has played many roles throughout its history. It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site and even a lookout for whale-watching.",

Spread over more than 320,000 hectares and originally part of Mexico, it became a part of the United States in 1848. Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a national park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.",

Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds.

Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for almost 2 kilometres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.",

Today's image features Steller sea lions gliding through the chilly waters off the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada. These marine mammals are heavy—females average more than 260 kilograms, while males are around 540 kilograms. Males are noticeably larger than females and are known for their loud roars and flatter snouts. Their deep vocalisations include belching, growling and snorting to warn others and communicate underwater. Males get loud to defend turf, while moms and pups use unique calls to find each other in a crowded rookery. Despite their size, they're preyed on by orcas and large sharks. These sea lions are considered near-threatened. Ocean conservation keeps them—and countless other mammals—afloat.",

Originally from Asia, the ring-necked pheasant was introduced to France during the Middle Ages. Today, it is a common sight in rural landscapes, particularly in Normandy, where it finds refuge in hedgerows, field edges and flowering meadows. Although it is not a threatened species, its survival depends on the quality of agricultural areas. The loss of hedges, wasteland and fallow fields reduces areas where it can nest and seek shelter.",

      "description": "Today's image takes us to Fumacinha Waterfall, one of the most beautiful yet least explored waterfalls in Chapada Diamantina National Park in Bahia, Brazil. With a height of approximately 100 metres, the access trail begins in the village of Baixão and is considered challenging due to its steep sections. The sound of the cascading water echoes through the canyon, providing a unique sensory experience. Surrounding the waterfall, a diverse range of wildlife—including exotic birds and small mammals—enhances the feeling of being in a pristine, untouched wilderness.",

      "description": "Nestled in a picturesque pond landscape just a few kilometres from Dresden, Germany, Moritzburg Castle stands proudly, as seen in today's image. Originally built in the 16th century as a hunting lodge for Maurice, Elector of Saxony, it was transformed into a country seat surrounded by a moat in the 18th century under Augustus the Strong. Today, it impresses visitors with its Baroque architecture and idyllic location on an artificial island. Majestic towers and halls, furnished with precious furniture and trophies, bear witness to the former splendour of the Saxon court. It is no wonder that this castle is not only the landmark of the town of the same name but is also regarded as one of the most beautiful Baroque castles in Germany.",
