Stretching more than 100 centimetres in length and standing over 70 centimetres tall at the shoulder, it is built for power and precision. Its padded paws aren't just for sneaking; they act like snowshoes, spreading its weight so it can chase down prey in deep winter drifts.

This village has appeared in films like 'The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' and 'Tomb Raider,' thanks to its Cycladic houses—cube-shaped homes with flat roofs—and cliffside views that feel almost unreal. Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected. Today, visitors wander its cobbled lanes, explore the Naval Maritime Museum or climb to the ruins of Agios Nikolaos Castle for unforgettable sunsets.",

For centuries, the area—nicknamed 'The Capital of the Adirondacks'—was used by Indigenous peoples for hunting and travel. By the late 19th century, it gained fame as a health retreat, where Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau pioneered fresh-air treatment for tuberculosis. The cure cottages from that era still stand today.",

Tucked within the Mamanuca group, this small volcanic islet stretches over a kilometre in length and 600 metres across, surrounded by turquoise waters and vibrant coral reefs. The reefs act as a natural fortress, protecting the island from storms while sheltering countless species of fish. They are a fitting metaphor: strong, diverse and deeply connected to the well-being of the nation. Beyond its waters, Monuriki is also home to the endangered Fiji crested iguana, one of the few places where this rare reptile can still be found. Together, the island's vibrant reef and unique wildlife make it a true natural treasure of Fiji.",

Found across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, from Hawaii in the United States to Africa's eastern coast, this reef-dweller is a true shapeshifter. Unlike most of its kin, it hunts in broad daylight, instantly shifting its colour, pattern and even skin texture to blend into its surroundings. At times, it even performs a clever 'passing clouds' act, casting a false shadow to trick crabs into moving at just the wrong moment. And once the trap is sprung, the hunter wastes no time. A skilled predator, this octopus prowls the reef for fish, crabs, prawns and molluscs. Smaller catches are devoured on the spot, while larger prey is dragged back to its den.",

Its name literally translates as 'Bridge of Peace and Propitiousness,' reflecting its role as both a practical crossing and a symbol of the city. The original bridge was built in 1746 but suffered repeated damage from floods over the centuries. The current structure, completed in 2003, preserves the architectural style of the Ming and Qing dynasties and spans 81 metres in length and 6 metres in width. The bridge features handrails with traditional floral carvings, water-beast statues on the piers and memorial archways on each side, reflecting classic Chinese architecture. It serves as a cultural landmark and a hub for tourism, featuring a restaurant on the upper level, hosting occasional cultural events and offering an illuminated night view that has become one of Chengdu's most photographed attractions.",

Travelling at nearly 28,900 km/h, the ISS circles Earth every 90 minutes, giving its international crew of seven the remarkable experience of witnessing 16 sunrises and sunsets each day. Its solar arrays soak up sunlight to power groundbreaking research on microgravity, technology and human survival beyond our planet. Shot from the SpaceX Crew Dragon Endeavour—a reusable spacecraft that has completed six missions since 2020, ferrying astronauts and cargo—this scene embodies what humanity can achieve when it chooses cooperation over competition. Each gleaming panel makes it clear: the final frontier is within reach and the audacity to explore it defines us.",

The landscape hums with echoes of the past: dinosaurs left footprints on these cliffs long before Mesolithic hunters traced its streams over 8,000 years ago. In the 9th century, seafaring Norse Vikings settled here. Centuries later, the powerful MacLeod and MacDonald clans claimed these lands, their castles standing guard over countless battles and alliances.",

One such gem is the Snake River, which winds through Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, United States. A particularly stunning spot along this river is Oxbow Bend—featured in today's image—where calm waters reflect the towering Teton Range and wildlife such as moose and bald eagles thrive. On calm days, Mount Moran can be seen mirrored on the water's surface, making the scene even more striking. Here, water flows freely, unbound by concrete or commerce, protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. At dawn, mist dances over the bend and the mountains blush with the first light.

It stands as a proud witness to the valour of the famed warrior clans—the Rajputs. Their name comes from the Sanskrit 'rajaputra,' meaning 'son of a king,' and they are celebrated for their noble lineage and martial traditions across northern India. The fort's stone walls have witnessed centuries of courage, pride and romance, remembered in the songs of Rajasthan's bards. According to legend, Bhim, a hero from the Hindu epic 'Mahabharata,' first laid its foundations.",

      "description": "Somewhere in the wide prairies of northeastern Wyoming in the United States, stands Devils Tower, a stone formation that rises from the open plains. Once called Bear Lodge, the butte gained its current name during an 1875 expedition led by Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, possibly after an interpreter mistranslated a Native phrase as 'Bad God's Tower.' The missing apostrophe in its official title follows standard geographic naming conventions—hence, the signs read 'Devils Tower.' In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed it as the nation's first national monument.",

A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-coloured bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring around 18-20 centimetres, the keel-billed toucan moults, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.",

      "description": "Every year, between late September and early October, Theresienwiese, a square in Munich, Germany, transforms into one of the world's largest festivals—Oktoberfest. First held in 1810 to celebrate a royal wedding, it has grown into a 16- to 18-day tradition attracting more than six million people from around the globe. The scale is staggering: the festival grounds span about 42 hectares and host 14 main tents, each seating thousands. Each year, visitors consume around seven million litres of beer, along with mountains of pretzels, sausages and gingerbread hearts. All beer served at Oktoberfest comes from Munich breweries and meets the strict standards of the Reinheitsgebot, the German Beer Purity Law.",

Seen from 362 kilometres above, the Gulf Coast glows like a constellation—clusters of light scattered across the dark. But what truly makes this view possible can't be seen: the ozone layer, silently shielding everything below from the sun's ultraviolet rays. By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.",

Their presence sometimes evokes a quiet intimacy—two birds drifting close, their movements mirroring one another in a delicate choreography, as if sharing a secret only the wetlands can hear. They hunt with quiet precision, gently picking insects, larvae and tiny crustaceans from the water's surface. Each movement reveals a subtle mastery of their environment, shaped by patience and instinct.",

After closing in 2007 due to rising rents, the concept was revived and redefined—returning in 2014 to its present home at Orchard Gateway where it continues to inspire a new generation of readers and creators. Spanning two visually distinct levels—The Studio and The Loft—this 1,700-square-metre space holds a curated collection of 100,000 items.

Young grizzlies often 'play-fight' to build strength, sharpen skills and establish social bonds. These heavyweight champs can weigh up to 410 kilograms and still sprint faster than most humans. And it's not just their strength and speed that impress; a grizzly's sense of smell is so powerful, it can detect food from over 30 kilometres away—seven times better than a bloodhound's. Once widespread across the western United States, grizzlies now primarily roam Alaska and parts of the Northern Rockies. Among many places in Alaska, Katmai National Park and Preserve is considered one of the best places in the world to observe grizzly bears in their natural habitat.",

Before Gering became a town in 1887 and decades before Nebraska achieved statehood in 1867, these sandstone and siltstone formations were already guiding thousands along the Oregon, California and Mormon Trails. Scotts Bluff National Monument is named after Hiram Scott, a fur trader with the Rocky Mountain Fur Company who died under mysterious circumstances nearby in the 1820s.",

Found in warm waters from the Maldives and Mozambique to Mexico's Yucatán coast, they often show up in food-rich, calm waters. Their mouths can stretch over a metre wide, but they feed by suction, not biting. Each has a unique pattern of white spots and stripes—no two alike—used by researchers to track individuals. Their breeding patterns remain largely a mystery, but they are ovoviviparous, meaning pups hatch inside the mother before being born alive. Their story reminds us how much ocean life remains a mystery and how vital it is to protect what we already know is at risk.",

The shift began in 1561, when the plaza came under Madrid's jurisdiction after the royal court moved from Toledo.

These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique and in this case, a clever one.

Despite the name, wheatears have nothing to do with wheat or ears—the name is a twist on the old phrase 'white arse,', pointing to the bird's distinctive white rump found in most species.  Globally, there are around 20 species of wheatears. Today's image features the northern wheatear. It weighs less than a kilogram, but travels thousands of kilometres between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa. Its migration route is one of the longest for a bird its size, crossing oceans and continents.",

Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls. Below, the marine area lines the narrow inlet with harbours, waterfront homes and a growing valley community.",

      "description": "It's a bird, it's a plane, it's … a fish! Gliding through the ocean with flapping fins and polka-dot flair, the spotted eagle ray refuses to blend in. It doesn't crawl along the seabed like its stingray cousins—it flies underwater. The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span up to 3 metres. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenceless either.",

Welcome to Corona Arch, seen in today's image, a towering Navajo sandstone formation that offers big adventure without the big crowds. The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles and even a metal cable assist makes it more than just a walk in the desert. After 2.4 kilometres of walking, the payoff is big: a massive arch that's 43 metres wide and 32 metres high. It's so large that people once swung from it on ropes, until that was banned for safety reasons. Even without the adrenaline stunts, the hike offers beautiful views and unforgettable moments in the heart of Red Rock Country.",

The reserve's rich ecosystem and seasonal wildebeest migration offer a front-row seat to the drama of lion life—from territorial battles to cooperative hunts. But Maasai Mara is more than a wildlife haven; it's a model for community-led conservation. Local Maasai communities work alongside conservationists to protect both lions and their ancestral lands, showing that coexistence is not only possible but powerful.",

But in its centre rests an unusual sculpture: gigantic steel letters intertwined in a knot. Created by artist Sérgio Cardoso in 2003, the work arrived before the roundabout itself—traffic circled around it before any road planning. Made of stainless steel and about 4 metres tall, its original name, 'Diálogo,' never stuck. For residents, it was always 'Bola das Letras.' And so, it remained: a spontaneous nickname, a reference that slipped out of control and became part of the urban landscape. Today, few remember the official title—or even the name of the roundabout.",

      "description": "Before GPS told ships where to go, lighthouses lit the way—each with its own flash pattern so sailors could figure out where they were, even in total darkness. And like many lighthouses around the world, Florida's Gasparilla Island Lights still hold their ground. The Gasparilla Island Rear Range Light, seen in today's image, has had quite a journey. Originally assembled in Delaware, it found its forever home here in 1927 but was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 2014. The lighthouse was restored to its former glory in 2017 and was switched on again in 2018. Today, it blinks white every six seconds. The lighthouse grounds and museum are open to visitors seasonally, offering insights into the area's shipping past.",

      "description": "It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.",

The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking colour to neighbourhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonisation, maritime trade and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from approximately 16°C in winter to 27°C in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe.",

Though absent from the driest regions of western India, it thrives in diverse habitats—from lowland plains to elevations of about 2,000 metres—often favouring areas with tall palm trees, forest clearings, and cultivated landscapes. These compact birds are easily recognised by their short, curved bills, square tails and long wings. They are usually seen in small groups, huddled closely together on bare branches, power lines or pylons, occasionally preening one another. Agile in flight, they make aerial sallies to catch insects mid-air—sometimes holding the prey in their feet, tearing it apart with their beaks. While they typically feed on the wing, they may also return to a perch—or even land on the ground—to consume their catch or visit birdbaths.",

Spanning over 98,160 hectares, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor centre and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about two centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats.",

It can be easily recognised by its thick, upright branches that can grow more than 2 metres tall. These strong, round branches look a lot like a stag's antlers, which is why it's called Staghorn coral. Scientifically named Acropora cervicornis, it is among the fastest-growing corals on Earth—serving as a central hub of biodiversity in the Western Atlantic.",

The moon's surface is mostly covered with rock and fine lunar dust, created by billions of years of impacts from meteoroids and micrometeorites.

Eucalyptus is now one of the most planted species in the country, the basis for the production of paper, cellulose and charcoal. When well-managed, especially in already degraded areas, it can relieve pressure on native forests and favour soil recovery.

These remarkable trees are the oldest non-clonal species on Earth. Shaped by relentless wind, snow and rain, they've endured for millennia—witnessing ice ages, volcanic eruptions and the rise and fall of civilisations. Their incredibly slow growth results in wood that's dense and highly resistant to insects, fungi, decay and erosion. Against all odds, the Great Basin bristlecones cling to life on barren limestone ridges, twisting into forms that appear almost sculpted by time. Their scattered presence across isolated mountain ranges may be due to wind dispersal, the help of birds like the Clark's nutcracker, or even now-extinct species that once carried their seeds across the highlands.",

      "description": "Today's image takes us to Kálfshamarsvík—a secluded cove on the country's remote Skagi peninsula. Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs. Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns. These sea cliffs are shaped into natural sculptures so symmetrical that they look almost man-made. These striking formations were created around 2 million years ago, when thick basalt lava cooled slowly, contracting and cracking into geometric shapes that formed near-perfect hexagons. Though Iceland is full of volcanic marvels, formations like these are rare, making this quiet cove truly remarkable.",

Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo. The city's skyline is defined by iconic skyscrapers such as the soaring Tokyo Skytree and the striking Metropolitan Government Building, while historic treasures like Senso-ji Temple, Meiji Shrine and the Imperial Palace Gardens provide a captivating window into Japan's rich cultural heritage.",

The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia.",

This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide.",

The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore. Sometimes, when the air and ground temperatures are just right, the Tor looks like it's floating above the mist—a trick of the light called a Fata Morgana. The name comes from Morgan le Fay, a sorceress in Arthurian legends. The Tor stands in the heart of the Summerland Meadows, which are part of the Somerset Levels. It rises to an elevation of 158 metres and is clearly visible from far away, making it a striking landmark. Although often described as an island, the Tor actually sits at the western tip of a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the River Brue.",

What you see at Arches National Park in Utah, United States, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.",

Long before European ships appeared on the horizon, the Carijós—skilled fishermen and farmers of the Tupi-Guarani group—lived here. By 1529, explorers had charted these waters and the name 'Santa Catarina' appeared on world maps. In the 18th century, waves of Azorean settlers arrived. The coast became a stage for disputes between Portugal and Spain, and in the centuries that followed, German and Italian immigrants added new colours to the region's tapestry. Fishing communities and ports flourished throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.",

      "description": "Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, beautifully captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly is known for its vivid colouration and powerful flight, making it a frequent visitor to both urban gardens and wild habitats. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important. The Asian swallowtail uses sophisticated colour vision and colour constancy to identify flowers, especially those in the citrus family, even under changing light conditions. This remarkable ability allows it to remain an effective pollinator across a wide range of environments. Delicate yet determined, the Asian swallowtail reminds us that even the smallest pollinators play a big role in keeping nature balanced and beautiful.",

Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines.",

There are seven species of sea turtles: green, loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley and flatback. Among them, the leatherback sea turtle is the largest, sometimes reaching almost 2 metres in length and weighing between 300 to 640 kilograms. Each species has unique behaviours, diets and nesting patterns—yet all share a deep connection to coastal and marine environments.

Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a national park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.",

Towering up to 1.5 metres tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot.",

Everglades National Park, located in Florida, is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, spanning more than 610,000 hectares. It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. Everglades National Park is not only a national treasure but also an international one, recognised as a World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve and a Wetland of International Importance.",

Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for almost 2 kilometres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.",

Today's image features Steller sea lions gliding through the chilly waters off the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada. These marine mammals are heavy—females average more than 260 kilograms, while males are around 540 kilograms. Males are noticeably larger than females and are known for their loud roars and flatter snouts. Their deep vocalisations include belching, growling and snorting to warn others and communicate underwater. Males get loud to defend turf, while moms and pups use unique calls to find each other in a crowded rookery. Despite their size, they're preyed on by orcas and large sharks. These sea lions are considered near-threatened. Ocean conservation keeps them—and countless other mammals—afloat.",

Today, it is a common sight in rural landscapes, particularly in Normandy, where it finds refuge in hedgerows, field edges and flowering meadows. Although it is not a threatened species, its survival depends on the quality of agricultural areas. The loss of hedges, wasteland and fallow fields reduces areas where it can nest and seek shelter.",

Majestic towers and halls, furnished with precious furniture and trophies, bear witness to the former splendour of the Saxon court.
